# Smartphone Measurements

This repository contains data measured from various smartphones that relate to energy consumption and throughput. Currently, data exists for four Samsung phones: S4 Mini, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy Note 4, and MEGA.

The Monsoon is a power monitor that can also be used as a supply. To measure each smartphone, the battery was disconnected and replaced with probes from the Monsoon to retrieve the amount of energy being used. The data provides power measurements for each of the phones along with voltage and current. In this series of data, the sample time was 0.2 seconds.

The iPerf directory contains the corresponding WiFi throughput of the smartphones during the experiment. The Bluetooth tests transferred a single fixed size file and were timed to calculate the throughput. LTE throughput was determined by using a free speed test app.
